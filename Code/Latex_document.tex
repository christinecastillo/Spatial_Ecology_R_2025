\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
I'm freezing outside, I feel my skin tight
My coat is inside, but I look up at you
I tracked your plane ride for when you're in tonight
Tell me, when is the next time I'll run into you? (Oh)
It sounds insane, right? (Uh-huh)
I'll take the same flight (mm, uh-huh)
Wait at your bedside (uh-huh)
I'll land right next to you (mm, uh-huh)
I'm going stateside (uh-huh)
Where I'll see you tonight (mm, uh-huh)
Tell me, how did a girl like me get into you? (Yeah, oh)
You can be my American, ha, ha, ha, ha
(You can be my American, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Is it right? I don't know
But you're taking my control
Never been abroad before
Now I'm knocking through your door
But you're nice, so I'll stay
Never met a British girl, you say?
No one treats me this way
Are all boys out here the same?

\subsection{Philosophy of this thesis}
\noindent What can I say? (Uh-huh) What can I do? (Uh-huh)
I'm tryna be the girl that you're talking to (uh, uh-huh)
And maybe you can be my American ha, ha boy
You can be my American ha, ha boy
Why can't you say that you want it too? (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I'm flying intercontinental with you (you)
And maybe you can be my American ha, ha boy
You can be my American, ha, ha
I'm freezing outside, I feel my skin tight
My coat is inside, but I look up at you (you)
I tracked your plane ride for when you're
Tell me, when is the next time I'll run into you?

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
As stated in Section \ref{sec:intro}, in this thesis, I made use of the function related to gravity, as in Equation \ref{eq:newton}.

\begin{equation}
    F=G\times \frac{m_1\times m_2}{r^2}
    \label{eq:newton}
\end{equation}

The above equation was too simple, and I relied also on Equation \ref{eq:complex}

\begin{equation}
    F=\sqrt[3] {G\times \frac{\sqrt{m_1 \times \sqrt{m_2}}}{r^2}}
    \label{eq:complex}
\end{equation}

\section{Results and Discussion}

Using the formulas presented in section \ref{sec:methods}, I attained the results shown in figure \ref{fig:result}

My results are in line with those attained by \citep{Lek}. Instead
